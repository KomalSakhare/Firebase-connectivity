# Firebase-connectivity
In this i have created a small html website in which i have connected the website to firebase . The feature of firebase which i have used is realtime database.

Firebase Realtime Database - The Firebase Realtime Database is a cloud-hosted database. Data is stored as JSON and synchronized in realtime to every connected client. When you build cross-platform apps with our Apple platforms, Android, and JavaScript SDKs, all of your clients share one Realtime Database instance and automatically receive updates with the newest data.

The Firebase Realtime Database lets you build rich, collaborative applications by allowing secure access to the database directly from client-side code. Data is persisted locally, and even while offline, realtime events continue to fire, giving the end user a responsive experience. When the device regains connection, the Realtime Database synchronizes the local data changes with the remote updates that occurred while the client was offline, merging any conflicts automatically.

The Realtime Database provides a flexible, expression-based rules language, called Firebase Realtime Database Security Rules, to define how your data should be structured and when data can be read from or written to. When integrated with Firebase Authentication, developers can define who has access to what data, and how they can access it.

The Realtime Database is a NoSQL database and as such has different optimizations and functionality compared to a relational database. The Realtime Database API is designed to only allow operations that can be executed quickly. This enables you to build a great realtime experience that can serve millions of users without compromising on responsiveness. Because of this, it is important to think about how users need to access your data and then structure it accordingly.

In this website their are two forms to which the firebase is connected .
The first form is Sign in , if the user already have an account the he/she must sign the , the data entered by the user will be be saved in our databse.
The next form is the Sign up form , if the user is new to the website the he/she must first sign up and complete the registration process , this data will also be saved in our database.

Once the data is entered in the form it will be saved in the database and can be available in offline mode as well.
